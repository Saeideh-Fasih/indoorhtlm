    <title>Migrate your old Table of Contents to the new TOC structure</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jupyter Book v0.11, we &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterbook.org/reference/_changelog.html#v0-11-0"&gt;introduced a new Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt; structure.
The new structure is a bit more rigid and explicit, which should allow for a cleaner mapping of TOC structures onto book structures.
It also introduces the concept of TOC &lt;strong&gt;formats&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows you to specify different &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of documents in the TOC (to start with, Books and Articles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a short guide to explain the differences between the old and new Table of Contents structures, to help you update them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an experimental post to try solving two problems with one blog post.
We often send out a flurry of tweets to talk about a new release in the Executable Books stack.
Weâ€™d also like to blog about releases more often so itâ€™s easier to track major updates.
This post is an attempt at crafting a blog post entirely made out of tweets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™re pleased to announce a new version of Jupyter Book has just been released! You can check out the CHANGELOG here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterbook.org/reference/_changelog.html#v0-11-0"&gt;https://jupyterbook.org/reference/_changelog.html#v0-11-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
