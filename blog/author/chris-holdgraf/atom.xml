&lt;p&gt;Within this collaboration, much of the development effort has been spent on building &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterbook.org/"&gt;Jupyter Book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/blog/2023/new-project-members/"&gt;which has been a tremendous success&lt;/a&gt;; there are at least 13,209 GitHub repositories using the tool according to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/network/dependents"&gt;dependency graph for the project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Furthermore, the reach of EB has grown to encompass documentation writers and package authors who use EB tools to provide a richer experience for their audiences. For example, six of the flagship scientific python projects&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#scipy" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;3&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/"&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/"&gt;Dask&lt;/a&gt; make use of at least one of the Sphinx-based tools we’ve developed such as the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io"&gt;PyData Sphinx Theme&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io"&gt;Sphinx Book Theme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io"&gt;MyST Markdown parser&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io"&gt;Jupyter Notebook parser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#popular" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Over the past four years, the Executable Book(s) (EB) project has been working to improve workflows for writing and publishing with Jupyter Notebooks, along with the broader open source science ecosystem.Within this collaboration, much of the development effort has been spent on building Jupyter Book, which has been a tremendous success; there are at least 13,209 GitHub repositories using the tool according to the dependency graph for the project.1 Furthermore, the reach of EB has grown to encompass documentation writers and package authors who use EB tools to provide a richer experience for their audiences. For example, six of the flagship scientific python projects3 like NumPy, Pandas, and Dask make use of at least one of the Sphinx-based tools we’ve developed such as the PyData Sphinx Theme, the Sphinx Book Theme, MyST Markdown parser, or the Jupyter Notebook parser.4</summary>

    <title>Expanding our team and the next phase of Executable Books development</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years, the Executable Books team has focused its efforts on building a Sphinx-based technical stack underlying the Jupyter Book project. This has been extremely successful, and Jupyter Book and the associated MyST ecosystem in Sphinx have gained adoption across both scientific and open source communities. The MyST Parser for Sphinx averages around 350,000 downloads a month, which makes up about 13% of all Sphinx downloads (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pepy.tech/projects/myst-parser?versions=*"&gt;https://www.pepy.tech/projects/myst-parser?versions=*&lt;/a&gt;). There are over 4000 Jupyter Books in public GitHub repositories (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/search?q=%22format%3A+jb-book%22&amp;amp;amp;type=code"&gt;https://github.com/search?q=%22format%3A+jb-book%22&amp;amp;type=code&lt;/a&gt;), many of which are now featured at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery/"&gt;gallery.executablebooks.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
