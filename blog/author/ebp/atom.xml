    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MyST Markdown is an extensible, semantic, and community-driven flavor of markdown designed for scientific and computational narratives.
It was created for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterbook.org"&gt;Jupyter Book&lt;/a&gt;, and has gained wide adoption in Pythonâ€™s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx/intro.html"&gt;Sphinx documentation ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Migrate your old Table of Contents to the new TOC structure</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jupyter Book v0.11, we &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterbook.org/reference/_changelog.html#v0-11-0"&gt;introduced a new Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt; structure.
The new structure is a bit more rigid and explicit, which should allow for a cleaner mapping of TOC structures onto book structures.
It also introduces the concept of TOC &lt;strong&gt;formats&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows you to specify different &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of documents in the TOC (to start with, Books and Articles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a short guide to explain the differences between the old and new Table of Contents structures, to help you update them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an experimental post to try solving two problems with one blog post.
We often send out a flurry of tweets to talk about a new release in the Executable Books stack.
Weâ€™d also like to blog about releases more often so itâ€™s easier to track major updates.
This post is an attempt at crafting a blog post entirely made out of tweets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™re pleased to announce a new version of Jupyter Book has just been released!

&lt;p&gt;Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books, websites, and documents from source material that contains computational content. With this post, weâ€™re happy to announce that Jupyter Book has been re-written from the ground up, making it easier to install, faster to use, and able to create more complex publishing content in your books. It is now supported by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/"&gt;the Executable Book Project&lt;/a&gt;, an open community that builds open source tools for interactive and executable documents in the Jupyter ecosystem and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
