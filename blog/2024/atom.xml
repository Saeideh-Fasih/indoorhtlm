    <title>Project Pythia Hackathon: Transitioning from JupyterBook to MyST Markdown</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last week members of the ExecutableBooks team attended the Pythia Cook-off 2024 hackathon to help support and introduce &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mystmd.org"&gt;MyST Markdown&lt;/a&gt; as the next generation infrastructure being used for Jupyter Book v2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Pythia serves as an education and training hub for the geoscientific Python community, acting as the educational wing of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pangeo.io/"&gt;Pangeo&lt;/a&gt; initiative. It provides an extensive range of Python-centered learning resources that are open-source, community-owned, geoscience-focused, and of exceptional quality. These resources and tutorials or “Cookbooks” offer ways to onboard into the geoscientific Python ecosystem and demonstrate ways to process and understand vast amounts of numerical scientific data using tools that support open, reproducible science, while fostering an inclusive community of practice. The Project Pythia technical stack has been based on Jupyter Book, whose next release is undergoing significant development at the moment through the mystmd project. Members of the MyST team attended the hackathon and helped with onboarding, development of new features, and bug fixes throughout the week. It was an exciting event that showcased the power of the new tools that we aim to capture in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this collaboration, much of the development effort has been spent on building &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterbook.org/"&gt;Jupyter Book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/blog/2023/new-project-members/"&gt;which has been a tremendous success&lt;/a&gt;; there are at least 13,209 GitHub repositories using the tool according to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/network/dependents"&gt;dependency graph for the project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Furthermore, the reach of EB has grown to encompass documentation writers and package authors who use EB tools to provide a richer experience for their audiences. For example, six of the flagship scientific python projects&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#scipy" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;3&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/"&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/"&gt;Dask&lt;/a&gt; make use of at least one of the Sphinx-based tools we’ve developed such as the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io"&gt;PyData Sphinx Theme&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io"&gt;Sphinx Book Theme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io"&gt;MyST Markdown parser&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io"&gt;Jupyter Notebook parser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#popular" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
