    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years, the Executable Books team has focused its efforts on building a Sphinx-based technical stack underlying the Jupyter Book project. This has been extremely successful, and Jupyter Book and the associated MyST ecosystem in Sphinx have gained adoption across both scientific and open source communities. The MyST Parser for Sphinx averages around 350,000 downloads a month, which makes up about 13% of all Sphinx downloads (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pepy.tech/projects/myst-parser?versions=*"&gt;https://www.pepy.tech/projects/myst-parser?versions=*&lt;/a&gt;). There are over 4000 Jupyter Books in public GitHub repositories (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/search?q=%22format%3A+jb-book%22&amp;amp;amp;type=code"&gt;https://github.com/search?q=%22format%3A+jb-book%22&amp;amp;type=code&lt;/a&gt;), many of which are now featured at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery/"&gt;gallery.executablebooks.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
